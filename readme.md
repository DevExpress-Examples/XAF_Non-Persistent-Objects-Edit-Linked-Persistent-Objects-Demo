# XAF - How to edit a collection of persistent objects linked to a non-persistent object

When a [non\-persistent object](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116516/concepts/business-model-design/non-persistent-objects) contains a collection of persistent business objects, you may need to edit linked objects right in the list view either in in-place or in `ListViewAndDetailView` mode. Also, if a linked persistent object is edited in a popup detail view, you may need to see changes in the source list view after they are saved.

This example demonstrates how you can perform these tasks in XAF applications.

> [!WARNING]
> We created this example for demonstration purposes and it is not intended to address all possible usage scenarios.
> If this example does not have certain functionality or you want to change its behavior, you can extend this example. This can be a complex task that requires good knowledge of XAF: [UI Customization Categories by Skill Level](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#ui-customization-categories), and you may need to research how our components work. Refer to the following help topic for more information: [Debug DevExpress .NET Source Code with PDB Symbols](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/403656/support-debug-troubleshooting/debug-controls-with-debug-symbols).
> We are unable to help with such tasks as custom programming is outside our Support Service scope: [Technical Support Scope](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#support).

## Implementation Details

1. The [NonPersistentObjectSpace](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace) created for the master object cannot handle linked persistent objects by default. To work with them, create a persistent object space and add it to the [AdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AdditionalObjectSpaces) collection. Set [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AutoDisposeAdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AutoDisposeAdditionalObjectSpaces) to `true` to automatically dispose of additional object spaces when the master is disposed of. 
2. Set [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AutoCommitAdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AutoCommitAdditionalObjectSpaces) to `true` to automatically commit changes made to linked persistent objects.
3. Set [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AutoRefreshAdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AutoRefreshAdditionalObjectSpaces) to `true` and subscribe to the [ObjectGetting](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.ObjectGetting) event, to refresh linked persistent objects when the non-persistent object view is refreshed. In the event handler, create a new instance of the non-persistent object and get fresh copies of linked persistent objects.
4. This example uses the `Category` property to filter the nested list view of persistent objects. To avoid  the object space modification when this property is changed, subscribe to the [BaseObjectSpace.ModifiedChanging](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.BaseObjectSpace.ModifiedChanging) event and set the `e.Cancel` parameter to `true` depending on other event arguments.
